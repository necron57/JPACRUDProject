# Lessons Learned
Learned how better use JUNIT tests so I can see if my DB can even be read/interacted with properly before becoming stuck.
After struggling with how to write the controller methods I realized that I was just overthinking what needed to be done, once that was done the WHOLE project went by really smoothly with little to no hiccups. 
Learning how to setup a database from scrath and then be able to enter data/manipulate said data of my own choosing was a really rewarding experience and I cannot wait to set up my own website/s in the future, getting better with bootstrap has and will help with this.
